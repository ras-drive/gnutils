# Contributing
First off, congratulations for wanting to contribute to this project!

If you would like to contribute to a tool which hasn't been started
yet please do, make sure to put in a pull request when you get the
simpliest prototype possible so that no one else starts on it!

If you would like to contribute to a tool which is in the progress
of being developed then you can make your changes along with a pull
request, it will be reviewed the next time I see it.

If you would like to contribute to a tool which has already been written
then make your changes, unless it is a bug, after they're reviewed it
will be in an "in progress change" and the next time a bug or big
change happens to it your changes will be pushed.
